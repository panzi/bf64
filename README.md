bf64
====

Unpack, list and mount BF64 archives. These archives can be found in certain
Ubisoft games.

Basic usage:

	bf64.py list <archive>                 - list contens of .bf archive
	bf64.py unpack <archive>               - extract .bf archive
	bf64.py mount <archive> <mount-point>  - mount archive as read-only file system

The `mount` command depends on the [llfuse](https://code.google.com/p/python-llfuse/)
Python package. If it's not available the rest is still working.

This script is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.

File Format
-----------

There is a lot of guesswork here. It is possible that I misaligned the
file entries and I know there is something more in the header of the archive.

Byte order is little endian and the character encoding seems to be 7-bit
ASCII. All offsets are absolute from the start of the file.

Basic layout:

	File header
	Chunk
		Chunk header
		File info table
		File data table
	Chunk...

### File Header

Size: 752 (at least in one example I saw)

There seems to be a table structure with several entries, but most are
empty. Two entries contain the strings `"ROOT"` and `"Bin"`. I don't have
enough data to find out more about this.

	Offset  Size  Type          Description
	     0     4  char[4]       file magic "BF64"
	     4   748  ?             ? (possible table of variable size)

### Chunk Header

Size: 12

	Offset  Size  Type          Description
	     0     4  int32_t       number of files
	     4     4  int32_t       next chunk offset
	     8     4  int32_t       ?

### File Info

Size: 137

	Offset  Size  Type          Description
	     0     4  ?             ?
	     4     4  int32_t       file data offset (see next section)
	     8     4  int32_t       always 0
	    12     4  int32_t       file size
	    16     4  int32_t       1-based file index, except for file 4, where it's -1
	    20     4  int32_t       previous field - 2, except for file 4 (2) and file 5 (-1)
	    24     4  int32_t       usually 1, for 4 files it's 0
	    28     3  ?             ?
	    31     1  uint8_t       always 72
	    32    64  char[64]      zero padded filename
	    34    73  ?             ?

### File Data

The file data offset in the file info structure points to the file size field
of the file data structure. So you need to add 4 to that offset to get the
location of the actual file data.

	Offset  Size  Type          Description
	     0     4  int32_t       file size (N)
	     4     N  uint8_t[N]    file data
